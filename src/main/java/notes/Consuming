CONSUMING A RESTFUL WEB SERVICE

    - Fetching a REST resource: It randomly fetches quotations about Spring Boot
    and returns them as JSON documents.

    - RestTemplate makes interacting with most RESTful services a one-line incantation.
    And it can even bind that data to custom domain types.
    - aka RestTemplate is used to make HTTP Rest Calls (REST Client).

    @JsonIgnoreProperties from the Jackson JSON processing library to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

   - To directly bind your data to your custom types, you need to specify the variable name to be exactly the same as
    the key in the JSON document returned from the API. In case your variable name and key in JSON doc do not match,
    you can use @JsonProperty annotation to specify the exact key of the JSON document.

    IN ConsumingRestApp you need:

        - logger, to send output to the log (the console, in this example).

        - RestTemplate, which uses the Jackson JSON processing library to process the incoming data.

        - CommandLineRunner that runs the RestTemplate (and, consequently, fetches our quotation) on startup.

    BEANS
    - JavaBeans are Java classes which adhere to an extremely simple coding convention

    They must:

    - implement java.io.Serializable interface: to save the state of an object
    - use a public empty argument constructor: to instantiate the object
    - provide public getter/setter methods:  to get and set the values of private variables/properties.
